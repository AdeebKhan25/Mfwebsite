# My First Website

Welcome to my very first web project! This site is a playful exploration of HTML, showcasing my early attempts at web development. It's full of humor, self-deprecation, and a touch of wit. If youâ€™re looking to waste some time, youâ€™ve come to the right place!

## About the Project

This website was created as a fun, experimental project to practice my HTML skills. It features tongue-in-cheek content about my "work experience," "skills," and tips on how to waste time effectively. Itâ€™s not meant to be taken seriously, so if youâ€™re here for serious content... you might want to check out Netflix instead!

## Features

1. Humorous Content: Enjoy a light-hearted take on a personal website, with sections that poke fun at traditional resume elements.
2. Interactive Lists: Tips and tricks on how to waste your time, from irritating gym-goers to trying to find the value of pi.
3. Playful Imagery: Accompanying images that add to the humorous tone of the site.
4. Contact Page: A fun page where you can pretend to subscribe to my email list or figure out my "mysterious" phone number.
